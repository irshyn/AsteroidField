# AsteroidField

## Description

This is a MonoGame-based spin-off of the classic Asteroids game.
The player navigates a spaceship trying to avoid being hit by an asteroid for as long as possible
and to collect gold pots that periodically appear on the screen.
Asteroids move downwards at different angles and speeds.
Every 15 seconds a new asteroid is added to the screen making the game more challenging.
To quit the game, the player should press Esc button.

The features include: collision detection between game objects, simple animation, sound effects and music,
fully functional menu system navigated by keyboard and mouse, high score system, game saving and loading options, and a one-click installer.
